            	<div class="highlight1">The Crew:</div>
				The Siskiyou Rappel Crew is a 21-person USFS initial attack crew based out of Grants Pass, OR. We have one national rappel aircraft, but routinely host additional helicopters on site as the season dictates that can be staffed as needed with the support of boosters and qualified district personnel. The crew consists of a Foreman, Assistant Foreman, Squad Leaders, Senior Firefighters and temporary seasonal employees. We also have the ability to retain positions for detailers and Wildland Firefighter Apprentices to support the needs of the local units.
<br /><br />

                <div class="highlight1">The Job:</div>
				The crew's primary duty is to respond to incidents within Region 6 which encompasses Oregon and Washington. Initial Attack, logistical support, mapping, LEO flights, SAR missions, Medevac and prescribed fire duties are commonplace in addition to off-forest assignments for qualified personnel. The crew is very busy from late June to mid September while the helicopter is on contract, and personnel can supplement adjoining districts assisting in fire suppression and fuels projects to extend their duties later in the year.
				<br /><br />

				<div class="highlight1">Physical Fitness:</div>
				A great deal of emphasis is placed on physical fitness. It should go without saying that the work we perform is extremely physically demanding and requires a high level of physical conditioning. Applicants must pass the Work Capacity Test (WCT) at the arduous level consisting of a three mile pack carrying 45 pounds in 45 minutes or less. Failure to pass the WCT in the specified time will lead to dismissal. <br><br>

The physical training (PT) test is administered on the first day of rookie training. The Physical Fitness Standards for the crew are as follows:

				<ul>
                	<li>1.5 mile run -- 11:00 or less</li>
                    <li>Push-ups -- 25 in one minute</li>
                    <li>Sit-ups -- 45 in one minute</li>
                    <li>Pull-ups -- 7</li>
					<li>Pack 110 pounds on level terrain for 3 miles in 90 minutes or less</li>
                </ul>
			(A maximum of 5 minutes will be allowed between exercises)<br>
<br>

Physical training during the course of the season will include running, hiking and cross training to increase cardiovascular endurance; strength and muscle conditioning through weightlifting, circuit training and core exercises.

We cannot stress enough the need to engage in a physical fitness program throughout the off season, and to show up to work in good shape to reduce the risk of injury and increase your chances of completing the training phase of the program.

				<br /><br />

				<div class="highlight1">Training:</div>
				The first five weeks of the season, starting in early May, will be dedicated to extensive physical fitness, classroom, field training and the National Rappel Academy. This training will include mandatory annual training and refreshers, S-271 and Interagency Helicopter Training as well as becoming certified as a rookie rappeller. There is no down time during the training and trainees must demonstrate competency and proficiency in all aspects of the training or they will be removed from the program. During the course of the season, other training courses may be offered to further the qualifications and career development of each individual which will be outlined on an Individual Development Plan (IDP).<br>
				<br>
				Only a small group of people are selected each year to become rappellers. It is a credit to those individuals to have been chosen for this position in terms of their abilities, character and proven performance. It is an opportunity that very few people get.<br>
				<br>
				The rookie training program is designed to train you to be a safe and effective rappeller. Rookie training is designed to prepare rookie rappeller candidates with the necessary mental fortitude, logic and reasoning skills, and physical capacity to succeed in highly dynamic and arduous work environments. The Forest Service spends a lot of time, effort, and money to train rookie rappellers. Success will require you to put forth your best effort.

				<div class="highlight1">Housing:</div>
				Government housing is available for crewmembers at the rate of $108.00 a pay period. The average local rent is $400.00 to $500.00 per month in the Grants Pass area and
                options are plenty. Temporary crewmembers have also gone in together to rent a house for the season which can offset individual costs and
                facilitate carpooling.

				<br /><br />

				<div class="highlight1">Work Dates:</div>

				Work usually starts in early May and ends in late September or early October. Crewmembers are hired on a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) 1039 hours in 1 year basis as a GS-0462-4 or 5. Students (STEP's) are under a NTE 1 Year appointment. Wildland Firefighter Apprentice/Detail employees do not have imposed limitations which allows the helitack program manager to coordinate timeframes with their host unit.

				<br /><br />
                
                <div class="highlight1">The Mission:</div>
